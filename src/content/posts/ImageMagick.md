[ImageMagick®](https://imagemagick.org/) is a free and [open-source](https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php) software suite, used for editing and manipulating digital images. It can be used to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images, and supports a wide range of file [formats](https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php), including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and PDF.

## What is ImageMagick?

ImageMagick is widely used in industries such as web development, graphic design, and video editing, as well as in scientific research, medical imaging, and astronomy. Its versatile and customizable nature, along with its robust image processing capabilities, make it a popular choice for a wide range of image-related tasks.

ImageMagick includes a command-line interface for executing complex image processing tasks, as well as APIs for integrating its features into software applications. It is written in C and can be used on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

The main website for ImageMagick can be found at [https://imagemagick.org](https://imagemagick.org/). The source code for this software can be accessed through a [repository](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick). In addition, we maintain a legacy version of ImageMagick [version 6](https://legacy.imagemagick.org/).

Creating a security policy that fits your specific local environment before making use of ImageMagick is highly advised. You can find guidance on setting up this [policy](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php). Also, it's important to verify your policy using the [validation tool](https://imagemagick.org/script/security-policy.php).
